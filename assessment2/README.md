This is an extension of the basic `starships` demo. It adds paging with next
and previous buttons.

### Topics covered
- AJAX
- Conditionally rendering a component (this "Loading..." message)

### Things to Notice
- AJAX call using jQuery
- Thunk library for dispatching async actions
- 3 actions for an API call
- All we use the API for is to update the state.
- How the `<h3>Loading</h3>` element is conditionally turned on and off.
